Structeezy comes with a set of keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow. You can customize them to your liking in the settings.

## UI Commands

These options allow to customize aspects related to the Structeezy panel interface and workflow.

:::note
The shortcuts visible on the screenshot are not the default ones, but my personal preference. Customize the shortcuts to fit your work style.
:::

### Open / Close Structeezy

- default: `alt + s`

This shortcut opens the Structeezy panel if it is closed, and closes it if it is open.

:::tip
As a developer, I use a Chrome extension called Hoverify to inspect the DOM. It uses the `alt + s` shortcut to open its panel. So I changed my Structeezy shortcut to `e + z` to avoid conflicts. It is very well positioned on my french keyboard, and I find it easier to remember too.  
On a US keyboard, the same keys would be `w + e`.

### Dock / Undock Structeezy

- default: `alt + m`

When you need to get rid of the structeezy panel, but don’t want to close it, because you are working on a snippet in the parser for example, this command reduces the Structeezy panel and places it at the bottom right of your screen, until you need it again.

### Expand / Collapse Structeezy

- default: `alt + x`

This expands the Structeezy panel so all structures become visible.

### Close the “Save Structure” Modal

- default: `alt + q`  

This closes the modal that appears when you save a structure.

### Save the Selected Structure

- default: `f1`

This opens the save structure modal to save the currently selected structure and its children as a custom structure.

### Save all Structures

- default: `f2`

This opens the save structure modal to save your whole structure tree as a custom structure.

## Inject Containers

These options allow to inject Bricks containing elements (elements that can nest children like divs or sections) pre-configured to render various `html`elements.
